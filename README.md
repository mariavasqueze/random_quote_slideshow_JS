# Random Quotes Slideshow

Purpose: When the button is clicked a random quote is taken from the quotes array in the JS file, and it's shown on the page. 
This is a simple exercise to practice JS functions, methods like Math.floor, string concatenation, object creation, and calling object properties.

Note: you can see the printed quote structure on the console, everytime the button is clicked. Also, the citation property of the objects is for referencing the complete citation, the in-text citation is a way of printing a more esthetic and simple line for reference.
